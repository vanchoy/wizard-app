## Introduction
This React SPA is an university exam project from `2019`. The project report is reflection on problem Wizard Bilpleje is facing as upcoming company
in B2B and B2C market expansion.. ([read full report](https://istoyanov.onrender.com))

### About
Wizard Bilpleje is a single - person company established in 2015. They offer a large
variety of car – cleaning services – starting from the simple wash, through washing of the
seats and finishing with a paint correction. They don’t have any website at all – all of the
information is spread along their Facebook page. Because of lack of the time, the owner had
to stop with the company – but he wants to run the business again. Our task will be to create a
complex website from the scratch, describing their services, prices and some car cosmetics
they want to sell. They also want to spread their business to business connections so we need
to present the content in the way, that could possibly attract their future customers.

## Requirements
Installed Node Version `18+` (otherwise you can't run the project) 

### Notes
- Originally, this project was developed in React `16+`. It has been updated to React `18` and NodeJS `19.0.1`.
- The project will not work on React versions `<18` in case you decide to change the current, unless you update the code accordingly to your desired one.

## Installation
```
npm i
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
